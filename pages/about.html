                    Howdy yall! I'm Michael, I am a Computer Engineering student here at Texas A&M. I have experience with Computer Architecture and Software Development. I am interested in learning more about customer communication and satisfaction, human-centric design, and AI + Machine Learning hardware implementations. At home, I love working with The Children's Shelter of San Antonio, a wonderful nonprofit organization that provides a safe haven for children in the San Antonio area. This past summer we started the development of the first Children's Shelter mobile app. It was cool to get to work with different parts of the organization, such as their IT and Public Relations teams, and I plan on continuing to work with them throughout my college career. A little known fact about me is I am a professional Minecraft gamer. I was top 50 worldwide in MCPVP, a competitive Minecraft Player-versus-player combat server.

                <p style="text-align: center;">
                Hi! My name is Hariza Mast. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Texas A&M University and am part of the 
                graduating class of 2022. I am currently part of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and I participated in TAMUhack last fall. 
                After graduating, I hope to work for a company that has made a positive impact on the world. There are so many different sectors 
                that Computer Science covers and I would love to be part of a company that exposes their employees to all the different regions of computer science. 
                In the future, I hope to join the business sector. Whenever I’m trying something I’m not familiar with, I go in with a mindset that I'm willing to learn and get better. 
                I become an active listener and I’m always asking questions if I don’t understand something. Also, I interact with my fellow peers who have a better understanding 
                of these concepts so that I can learn from them. 
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    Altamash is an undergraduate engineering student at Texas A&M University pursuing a major in Computer Science and minors in Cybersecurity and Mathematics. He has a passion for software and security. His interest in the privacy, security, and transparency of software systems has turned him into a strong proponent of blockchain. Altamash has a strong background in other fields as well. He was one of ten students selected for Texas A&M’s inaugural Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Program. As part of this program, he got to work as a tier-one analyst alongside professionals in the campus security operations center. He investigated security events from campus-wide data sources, responded to threats, and mitigated risks. Before that, Altamash had been a member of DECA for 4 years. DECA is a student-led business organization where young professionals tackle different marketing case studies and scenarios. He competed at the international DECA competition in 2017 and 2018.
