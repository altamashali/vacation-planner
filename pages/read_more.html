        <h1 style="text-align: center;">What is Vacation Planner?</h1>  
        <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;" >
            Today, when planning a vacation, there are numerous things to consider. Hotel packages,
            flight times, restaurant suggestions and potential attractions are all scattered among the web on
            sites such as Triposo, Amadeus, and MediaWiki. What our teams wants to allow for is
            an easier method of vacation planning, by combining APIs from different travel agencies.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">
            This will help individuals plan their first vacation if he or she is new to trip planning, as well as
            allow for experienced individuals to find the options their destination has to offer in a more
            efficient manner. Because costs are a big factor in which destinations a vacation-goer chooses
            to travel to, our vacation planner will be able to find the most suitable and cost-effective vacation
            based on the travellerâ€™s budget preferences.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">
            Although the Internet has made it possible for the average person to conveniently plan a trip, it
            has also made it much more complicated due to the abundance of choice it provides. The sheer
            number of flights and hotel options available today leave people wondering where to even begin
            searching. The goal of our application is to simplify the process of planning a trip so that a
            person with any level of computer skill is able to successfully plan a trip for themselves and
            others in a quick, easy, and cost-effective manner.
